# WordsRevision

This program tracks and maintain a user’s revision history of English words and save the history in a file named “history.txt”. The program has two main data manipulation tasks:

Add a word into “history.txt”: if the word does not exist in the history, add this word and one example sentence; otherwise, display the existing example sentence(s) and give the user an option to add one example sentence.

Revise a word in “history.txt”: Display the chosen word and associated example sentence(s). The user has the option to choose the word based on the latest revision time or the number of revisions made to the word.
